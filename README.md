# Classification-using-multiple-predictive-models - The objective of this exercise is to build different classification models (bagging, boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) to classify the employess of a company into two groups; one who use car to commute to office while another group which uses other modes of transport.
The data set used as predictors includes eight variables (age, gender, profession, work experience, salary, distance of workplace from home and whether the employee has a driving license).
The target variable initially has three categories of employess - car users, public transport users and two wheeler users. Since our objective is to classify the empoyess into two categories (car users and non-car users), the target variable has been converted into a two class problem in the data transformation process.
